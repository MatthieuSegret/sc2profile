    p.name
    => <Name>
    
    
    p.race
    => <Race>
    
    p.race.to_style
    => background: url('<Path>race-symbols.png') <ImageX> <ImageY> no-repeat; width: 25px; height: 25px;


    p.league
    => <LeagueName> <LeagueType> Rank <Rank>
    
    p.league.to_style # size => :small, :medium, :big
    => background: url('<Path><LeagueName>.png') <ImageX> <ImageY> no-repeat; width: <ImageSize>; height: <ImageSize>;
    
    p.league.to_json
    => "{'league_name': 'gold', 'league_type': '1v1','rank': '25'}"

    p.portrait_style.to_json
    => "{'image_index': 0, 'image_x': '0px','image_y': '0px'}"
