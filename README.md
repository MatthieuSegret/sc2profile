# sc2stats

Parses a Battle.net StarCraft 2 profile for name, 1v1 league and 1v1 league points.

## Usage

    p = SC2Stats.new("<profile url>")
    => <Name> (<League>, <Points> pts)

    p.name
    => <Name>

    p.league
    => <League>

    p.points
    => <Points>

A profile that has not yet been placed will return:

    <Name> (No league, 0 pts)
